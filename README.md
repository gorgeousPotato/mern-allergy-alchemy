2. To discover allergen-free recipes, we should first create our allergy profile by listing all the ingredients to which we are allergic.

3. On the personalized recipes page, we can view only those recipes that do not contain ingredients listed in our allergy profile.

On the recipe detail page, we'll find a picture of the dish, preparation and cooking times, difficulty level, author information, category labels (such as gluten-free, milk-free, and egg-free), a list of ingredients, and the preparation method. Additionally, we can click the "Nutrition Details" button to access information about the recipe's nutritional content. Furthermore, while browsing recipes, we can simply click the checkboxes next to ingredients to add them to our shopping list.

7. On the Nutrition page, you can view detailed information about the microelements and vitamins contained in the recipe, including the total amounts, quantities per 100g, and the percentage of daily values per 100g. 

8. You have the option to contribute your own recipes and share them with the community. Adding a recipe involves a two-step process. In the first step, you provide the title and all the necessary information about the recipe.
